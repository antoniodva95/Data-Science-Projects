In this folder I preprocessed and created a machine learning model for the customer churn predictions kaggle dataset. Since most of the features were normal distributed and categorical ones didn't give much info, preprocessing (only some feature engineering was needed) was really easy to handle. GradientBoostClassifier and XGBoost are shown to be best models in terms of accuracy, precision and recall in both hold out train test split and K-Fold cross validation. Always in this folder you can find train and test files for kaggle submission, the model trained at the end of the my notebook and the csv with the predictions of the model, made by predicting on the test.
