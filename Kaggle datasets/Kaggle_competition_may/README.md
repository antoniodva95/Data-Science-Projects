This folder contains EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis) and pipelines for production model files (notebook and python script) for the dataset Tabular\_Series\_Binary\_Classification for Kaggle May Competition.

The EDA shows features' distributions, decoding of 'f27' string variable and shapley-valued feature interactions. Pipelines features preprocessing (feature selection and engineering) and data modeling. LGBM Classifier was selected as the final model for production.

Since some files are really big you can find and download here:
